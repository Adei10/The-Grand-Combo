EVTDESC666666004a;Word has reached us that the Poles have been organizing a revolt against our rule. Aided by ?igr? from France, they are beginning to organize in the city of Posen right now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC666666004;A demonstration in the city of Posen, in the Grand Duchy of Posen, soon turned sour when the Polish-run "Polish National Committee" went from demanding autonomy for the Poles and reconciliation among the Poles, Germans and Jews, to restrict its membership to Poles only in a move to maintain supremacy within their own organization. Days later, an opposing "German Committee" was formed, which was largely influenced by German public officials loyal to the Prussian King and disgruntled Jews expelled from the Polish Committee... Soon enough the breakdown of Prussian authority allowed long-simmering resentments to explode: Polish nobility and peasantry took up arms, preparing for confrontation with the Prussian Army which was sent to quell the protests, Prussian symbols were torn down, and in a couple of places, fighting erupted with German colonists all across the Grand Duchy.;;;;;;;;;x

courland_tobago_title;The Tobago Purchase;;;;;;;;;x
courland_tobago_desc;From 1654 to around 1689, the Island of Tobago of the Lesser Antilles belonged to the Colony of New Courland until a series of unfortunate events forced the Duchy to sell it to the British, who are to this very day the masters of the Island. Indeed ripping it off the hands of the British will be difficult, but we could obtain it by making a high enough offer... If not, we have a valid casus belli to make it ours once more. The story of Colony of New Courland is a sad one, but by placing it within our grasp once again we could amend the hardships the colonists suffered way back then. Though its climate might not be the best, as the island is located within the Atlantic Hurricane Belt, locals and botanists alike describe it as a "Tropical Paradise" when it's not being ravaged by storms.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME666666117;Curonian Gambia - The Gambian Purchase;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC666666117;Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland from 1642 to 1682, engaged in several attempts at colonization, one of which was the land around the province of Banjul in the Gambia. The fledgling colony had many troubles until it was stolen by the Dutch and subsequently by the British, the French, Swedish and many others until it came back to British hands. As our standing and influences in the international community grows, we can now demand the masters of the Gambia to hand over their Gambian colony on the basis of the first ownership act. Our control of Courland-Semigallia allows us to lay claims on it. And if they do not hand it back, we would have a very valid casus belli against them. Alternatively, we could make them a nice offer of 250,000?for the whole colony and obtain it peacefully.;;;;;;;;;x
