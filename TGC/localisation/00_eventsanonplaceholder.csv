the_commonwealth_3_nations_desc;In the old commonwealth, the First Union of Horodlo served as a major step in the modernization and Europeanization of Lithuania, which gave them equal rights to Poles and marked the beginning of the Commonwealth Proper. A Second Union was proclaimed by the Congress Poland rebels in an earlier revolution and was to be based on the three nations of Poland, Lithuania and Ruthenia... Sadly, as Polish furor and nationalism took over upon liberation, talks of this second union have been suspended until now... Several Ruthenian nobles have called for a Third Union of Horodlo - citing the last revolution of Congress Poland, along with the rising Ruthenian Nationalism free from Russian oppression - to grant Ruthenian a status equal to Poles and Lithuanians by elevating the Ruthenian Nation, as a Grand Duchy, in full membership with the current Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;x

madagascar_purchase_title;The Madagascar Purchase;;;;;;;;;x
madagascar_purchase_desc;$COUNTRY$ is in dire need of a colony, and given our good standing with our friendly colonial powers, we are in position to purchase a most excellent place: Madagascar. An island in South-East Africa with the strangest fauna and an exotic native culture, though its hot climate might seem like a detriment for most people in our nation, our politicians, botanists and explorers alike are quite sure there shall be plenty of natural resources to exploit. Plus, if the deal to purchase Madagascar is successful, we can even use the place as a dumping ground for our surplus undesirables.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME666666108;The Madagascar Purchase;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC666666108;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached our government officials with quite a distinct proposition: The purchase of the Island of Madagascar. They are offering an estimated value of 1,000,000?for the whole island. And while this might seem like a great deal for us, we cannot forget the fact that we would be helping a rising Great Power consolidate itself as a possible competitor in the Colonizing stage.;;;;;;;;;x
EVT666666108OPTA;It matters not, 1,000,000?is 1,000,000?;;;;;;;;x
