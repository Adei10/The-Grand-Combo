EVTDESC666666004a;Word has reached us that the Poles have been organizing a revolt against our rule. Aided by ?igr? from France, they are beginning to organize in the city of Posen right now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC666666004;A demonstration in the city of Posen, in the Grand Duchy of Posen, soon turned sour when the Polish-run "Polish National Committee" went from demanding autonomy for the Poles and reconciliation among the Poles, Germans and Jews, to restrict its membership to Poles only in a move to maintain supremacy within their own organization. Days later, an opposing "German Committee" was formed, which was largely influenced by German public officials loyal to the Prussian King and disgruntled Jews expelled from the Polish Committee... Soon enough the breakdown of Prussian authority allowed long-simmering resentments to explode: Polish nobility and peasantry took up arms, preparing for confrontation with the Prussian Army which was sent to quell the protests, Prussian symbols were torn down, and in a couple of places, fighting erupted with German colonists all across the Grand Duchy.;;;;;;;;;x
